This library is intended to provide easy use as ADS client applications running on non-windows systems (e.g. FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, ...) to communicate with TwinCAT devices via TCP/IP.

To build this library a recent compiler with C++11 support is required. 

Currently (2021-03-10) tested with:
===================================

host (amd64)     | target| compiler
-----------------|-------|-------------
FreeBSD 13.0     | amd64 | clang 11.0.0
macOS 11.2.3     | amd64 | clang 12.0.0
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS | amd64 | clang 6.0.0
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS | amd64 | gcc 7.5.0
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS | i686  | gcc 7.5.0
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS | win32 | gcc 5.5.0
Windows 10       | win64 | gcc 8.3.0


compile & usage
===============
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Beckhoff/ADS.git

# change into root of the cloned repository
cd ADS

# configure meson to build the library into "build" dir
meson build

# let ninja build the library
ninja -C build


Prepare your target to run the example
======================================
- Download your PLC project to your target e.g. "PLC-TestProject" of our GitHub repository.
- Authorise your ADS client for the TwinCAT target by adding an AMS route.

Sample AMS route:
  Name:           MyAdsClient     
  AMS Net Id:     192.168.0.1.1.1 # Derived from the IP address of your ADS client
  Address:        192.168.0.1     # Use the IP which is connected to the TwinCAT target
  Transport Type: TCP/IP
  
Routes can be configured by several possibilities
TwinCAT Engineering:  Go to the tree item SYSTEM/Routes and add a static route.
TwinCAT Systray:      Open the context menue by right click the TwinCAT systray icon. (not available on Windows CE devices) 
  TC2*: Go to Properties/AMS Router/Remote Computers
  TC3:  Go to  Router/Edit routes.
TcAmsRemoteMgr: Windows CE devices can be configured locally (TC2*/TC3). Tool location: /Hard Disk/System/TcAmsRemoteMgr.exe
IPC Diagnose: Beckhoff IPC’s provide a web interface for diagnose and configuration. Further information: http://infosys.beckhoff.de/content/1033/devicemanager/index.html?id=286

*Requires a TwinCAT restart.

- set "remoteNetId" and "remoteIpV4" and enable AdsSetLocalAddress() in "example/example.cpp" according to your own setup

# configure meson to build example into "build" dir
meson example/build example

# let ninja build the example
ninja -C example/build

# and run the example
./example/build/example
