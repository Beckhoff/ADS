# CHECK_RELEASE controls the consistency checking of the support
#   applications pointed to by the RELEASE* files.
# Normally CHECK_RELEASE should be set to YES.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to NO to disable checking completely.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to WARN to perform consistency checking but
#   continue building anyway if conflicts are found.

# Set this when your IOC and the host use different paths
#   to access the application. This will be needed to boot

# You must rebuild in the iocBoot directory for this to
